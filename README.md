## Intro

Learning to code is a long and difficult journey. As a developper, our memories and ability to remember are put at test everyday. In that context, Code Snippets are invaluable when you learn to code. 

Code Snippets are everywhere in the developer info stream, on twitter, stack overflow, tutorials, medium/blog articles ... However, there is no way to easily and efficiently store, organise, index and search/find them for futur use. At best you have a (very long) static file on GitHub, or worst, a google doc :(.

Codelify is the tool to go to to resolve this challenge. It was born during Lambda School 2019/20 winter Hackathon 


## Key Features

Codelify is deployed at [codelify.dev](https://codelify.dev).


It allows developers to have a centralised place to easily:



- Create and Store
- Organise, Upadate, Delete
- Index (Title, Description, Tags)
- Share


Code Snippets you they to keep. Snippets that they find from the world wide web, as well as snippets that you created alike. Then, when the time comes, and it will come :) you can easily find and (re)use them

## Tech Stack

- Codelify Project front-end is Built using Reactjs, Apollo, GraphQL
